# ChitChat

This is a simple forum application written in Go.

- Configurable via a `config.json` file
- Implements logging functionality (output to `chitchat.log` file)
- Includes test files
- All structs are fully defined
- Some functions are implemented as methods of struct types rather than package-level functions
